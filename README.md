# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
Import math

### Step 2:
 Assign the values of two points

### Step 3:

import math
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
